<h1>Coding is Cool</h1>
<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

<p><em>Without coding, computers would literally do nothing.</em> They would be completely useless. That’s because source code is the set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Computers have no free will, after all, so without explicit instruction, they’re just sophisticated hunks of metal.</p>


<p>A lot of people don't really understand what coding is. But people who learn how to code are able to     apply it beyond their computers. Coding forces you to collaborate with other people and solve problems in an effectively and productively. Even if you've never coded before, there are several reasons why you should consider learning to code.</p>


<p>Apart from companies in the technology sector, there are an increasing number of businesses relying on computer code. No wonder that eight of the top 25 jobs this year are tech positions, according to Glassdoor. A software engineer could just as easily find themselves working at Apple, as they could in a hospital, or at an automotive manufacturer.   </p>

<p>One major revelation: <em>Half of all programming openings are in industries outside of technology.</em> Among them:  Finance, Manufacturing, Health Care.  As a result, coding has become a core skill that bolsters a candidate’s chances of commanding a high salary. Burning Glass researchers found that jobs that require coding skills pay up to $22,000 per year more, on average. &quot;For students looking to increase their potential income, few other skills open the door to as many well-paying careers,&quot; they write in the report. Nearly half (49%) of all jobs that pay more than $58,000 require some coding skills, according to their analysis.   </p>

  <p><em><strong>Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.  ~Stephen Hawking</strong></em></p>

<p>Think of anything you’ve ever done with a computer:  ask this question on Quora, play a video game, send an email, search for something on Google, write a word document, take a selfie on your smartphone (also a computer), request an Uber, and watch a movie on Netflix.  All of those <strong>applications</strong> are <strong>software</strong> written in <strong>code</strong>.   </p>
